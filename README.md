# logos-libp2p-module

`logos-libp2p-module` is a Logos module that integrates libp2p networking capabilities (via [nim-libp2p](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-libp2p) C [bindings](https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-libp2p/tree/master/cbind)) into the Logos ecosystem.

It provides:
- Peer connectivity
- Stream management
- Kademlia DHT operations
- Gossipsub operations
- Sync and async APIs compatible with Qt

For guided walkthroughs and complete usage demonstrations, see the
[tutorials](./tutorial/README.md).

# Configuration

When the module is loaded by `logoscore`, it is constructed without arguments, so
options are supplied through the `LIBP2P_MODULE_CONFIG` environment variable — set
to either inline JSON or a path to a JSON file. The config is overlaid onto the
defaults at load time; every key is optional, and an omitted key keeps its default.
If the config is unset, unreadable, not valid JSON, or has a wrong-typed field, the
module logs a warning and falls back to the full default options.

```bash
# inline
export LIBP2P_MODULE_CONFIG='{
  "addrs": ["/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/9000"],
  "bootstrapNodes": [
    { "peerId": "16Uiu2...", "addrs": ["/ip4/1.2.3.4/tcp/9000"] }
  ],
  "transport": "tcp",
  "privKey": "08021220..."
}'

# or a file
export LIBP2P_MODULE_CONFIG=/etc/logos/libp2p.json
```

See [`config.example.json`](./config.example.json) for a ready-to-edit sample and
the `config` section of [`metadata.json`](./metadata.json) for the full schema.
Code that constructs `Libp2pModuleImpl` directly (tutorials, tests) passes
`Libp2pModuleOptions` to the constructor and bypasses this path.

## GossipSub queue bounds

Delivered messages wait in a per-topic queue until `gossipsubNextMessage` pops
them. Both bounds apply together, because 1024 messages at the 1 MiB GossipSub
message limit is still 1 GiB per topic.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gossipsubQueueMaxMessages` | `1024` | Messages held per topic. `0` disables the queue. |
| `gossipsubQueueMaxBytes` | `4194304` | Bytes held per topic. `0` disables the queue. |

Past either bound the newest message is dropped and counted in
`libp2p_module_gossipsub_queue_dropped_total`, reported per topic by
`collectMetrics` alongside `libp2p_module_gossipsub_queue_depth`. The byte bound
holds on an empty queue too, so keep `gossipsubQueueMaxBytes` above
`gossipsubMaxMessageSize`: a larger message never fits and is always dropped.
Set `gossipsubQueueMaxBytes` to `0` if your application reads only the
`gossipsubMessage` event. `gossipsubMaxMessageSize` below raises the per-message
ceiling, so raise it and the queue bounds together.

## GossipSub ingress limits

The queue bounds hold what a peer already delivered. These keys bound what a
peer can deliver, and nim-libp2p applies them inside GossipSub.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gossipsubMaxMessageSize` | `0` | Largest message accepted or sent, in bytes. `0` keeps the core 1 MiB limit; the ceiling is `MAX_GOSSIPSUB_MESSAGE_SIZE`. |
| `gossipsubOverheadRateLimitBytes` | `0` | Per-peer budget of protocol-overhead bytes per interval. `0` disables the limit. |
| `gossipsubOverheadRateLimitIntervalMs` | `0` | Refill interval of that budget, up to `MAX_OVERHEAD_RATE_LIMIT_INTERVAL_MS`. |
| `gossipsubDisconnectPeerAboveRateLimit` | `false` | Disconnect a peer that spends its budget. |

A rate limit needs both `gossipsubOverheadRateLimitBytes` and
`gossipsubOverheadRateLimitIntervalMs`, and every key here needs
`mountGossipsub`. A broken combination fails node creation with the reason, so a
node never starts with a limit that does nothing. While
`gossipsubDisconnectPeerAboveRateLimit` is `false`, an empty budget only
increments `libp2p_gossipsub_peers_rate_limit_hits`; set the flag to enforce it.

# Address screening

Some multiaddresses are invalid *by construction* as a destination, and the
module refuses them without a network round trip. See `src/addr_filter.h`.

| class | example | dial | publish |
|---|---|---|---|
| wildcard bind address | `/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/53924`, `/ip6/::/tcp/4001` | rejected | rejected |
| port-0 placeholder | `/ip4/192.168.1.158/tcp/0` | rejected | rejected |
| loopback | `/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/53022` | allowed | desktop and the iOS simulator only |

`addrs` in the **config** is untouched: `/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/0` is a perfectly good
*listen* argument and stays one. The screening applies to addresses that cross
the network:

- `connectPeer`, `circuitRelayReserve`, `peerstoreAddPeer` and
  `peerstoreSetPeerAddresses` drop un-dialable entries and fail with
  `no dialable address` if that was all the caller supplied. An empty list keeps
  its old meaning ("use the peerstore"). `dialCircuitRelay` takes a single
  address, so it is all-or-nothing: an un-dialable one fails with
  `un-dialable relay address <addr> (<reason>)`.
- `createXpr` screens the set it signs, and resolves an empty `addrs` to the
  node's bound addresses *here* rather than letting libp2p fall back to every
  socket the switch bound — which is where the loopback entry came from.
  Un-publishable throughout fails with `no publishable address`.
- Peer records arriving from other nodes (`discoLookup`, `discoRandomLookup`,
  `kadGetRandomRecords`, `kadGetProviders`, `peerstoreGetPeerInfo`,
  `circuitRelayReserve`'s reply) come back with the un-dialable entries removed,
  since they arrive from nodes nobody here controls. `decodeXpr` is left
  faithful: it is an inspector and reports what the record actually says.

On a physical device this matters most: loopback there is the device itself, so
a published `127.0.0.1` can only ever reach a node inside the same app. On the
iOS simulator, which shares the Mac's loopback, it accidentally works — which is
why this went unnoticed until an iPad run. See logos-workspace#206.

## The set the node announces about itself

Everything above is a set the module is handed or hands back. The node's **own**
announced set — nim-libp2p's `peerInfo.addrs` — is different: it is built from
every socket the switch bound, and service discovery signs it into the record it
publishes on its own. No module call passes through it, so the only screen that
reaches it is one nim-libp2p applies. `announcedAddressPolicy` chooses that one:

| value | announced |
|---|---|
| `unfiltered` | every socket the switch bound |
| `dialable` | minus the wildcard bind address and port 0 |
| `routable` | minus loopback as well |

It defaults to `routable` on an Android or physical-iOS build and `dialable`
everywhere else — the same answer `addr_filter.h` gives for the sets the module
screens itself. A node with nothing routable to say announces an empty set
rather than a placeholder.

Independently of that choice, addresses *learned* from other nodes — through
identify and through the Kademlia routing table — are screened with the
`dialable` rule before they are stored, since they arrive from nodes nobody here
controls.

This half lives in `nix/patches/announced-addresses.patch`, applied to the
`nim-libp2p` flake input by `flake.nix` (desktop) and `nix/mobile-cbind.nix`
(iOS, Android). `vacp2p/nim-libp2p` is not a fork this workspace can push to, so
the patch is how a change to it is carried — the same route
`logos-delivery-module` takes for its own nwaku patches.

# Running a node via logoscore

The module can be driven directly from `logoscore` without any other module. A
default node is created when the module is loaded; `createNode` then rebuilds it
from a call-time config (same schema as `LIBP2P_MODULE_CONFIG`, so `@config.json`
expands to the file's contents), and `getNodeInfo` reads back node details.

First build the module's `.lgx` bundle, install it into a modules directory, and
start the daemon against that directory:

```bash
nix build '.#lgx'                       # result/ holds the .lgx bundle
lgpm --modules-dir ./modules --allow-unsigned install --file result/*.lgx
lgpm --modules-dir ./modules list       # confirm "libp2p_module" is listed

logoscore -D -m ./modules &             # start the daemon against ./modules
```

The daemon binds its socket asynchronously, so the first `load-module` can race
it — retry once if it reports an RPC failure. Then drive the node:

```bash
logoscore load-module libp2p_module
logoscore call libp2p_module createNode @config.example.json   # or inline JSON
logoscore call libp2p_module start
logoscore call libp2p_module getNodeInfo Version        # module version
logoscore call libp2p_module getNodeInfo MyBoundPorts   # bound ports, e.g. [9000]
logoscore call libp2p_module getNodeInfo PeerId         # this node's peer id
logoscore call libp2p_module getNodeInfo Multiaddrs     # full bound multiaddrs
logoscore stop
```

`createNode` is optional: if you set `LIBP2P_MODULE_CONFIG` before loading, the
node is already configured and you can `start` straight away. Calling
`createNode` tears down the existing node and builds a fresh one from the supplied
config, so issue it before `start`. It accepts inline JSON or `@config.json`
(the file's contents); wrap inline JSON in single quotes so the shell doesn't
mangle it.

`logoscore` only relays a generic "call failed" to the CLI; the specific reason
(`createNode: invalid config: …`, `libp2p_new failed: …`) is written to the
daemon's stderr, so check the daemon output (or its redirected log) when a call
fails.

A scripted version of this flow runs in CI and locally via
`nix run .#standalone-e2e` (see [`tests/README.md`](./tests/README.md)).

# Custom-protocol bridge

Another module can run its own length-prefixed protocol on this node, instead of
starting a second libp2p node. Every argument and every result is one JSON
string, and every payload is base64, because that is the only shape the
universal codegen marshals.

| Call | Args | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `protocolRequest` | `{peerId, proto, multiaddrs?, requestB64, timeoutMs?, maxSize?, expectResponse?}` | `{responseB64}` |
| `mountProtocol` | `proto` | (none) |
| `protocolAcceptStream` | `{proto, timeoutMs?}` | `{streamId, proto, peerId}` |
| `streamReadLpJson` | `{streamId, maxSize?, timeoutMs?}` | `{dataB64}` |
| `streamWriteLpJson` | `{streamId, dataB64}` | (none) |
| `streamCloseJson` / `streamReleaseJson` | `{streamId}` | (none) |
| `pingPeer` | `peerId`, `timeoutMs` | `{peerId, rttMs}` |

`protocolRequest` does connect, dial, write, read and release in one call, so it
covers a request and response exchange.

The module boundary carries no push events, so an inbound stream waits in a
per-protocol queue and the consumer polls it with `protocolAcceptStream`.
`peerId` is the peer that opened the stream, which a service protocol needs to
answer the right peer. A stream leaves the queue when `protocolAcceptStream`
hands it out, when `streamReleaseJson` releases it, or when the node stops.
Mounting needs no event listener, so a consumer that only polls never sets one.

Each inbound stream also fires a `protocolStream` event with the same
`{streamId, proto, peerId}`. Drive a stream from the queue or from the event,
never from both: the two report the same stream, and the second reader finds a
handle another one already released.

The queue holds 1024 streams per protocol. Past that the newest inbound stream
is released, and the drop is counted, so a consumer that stops polling loses
streams instead of pinning them:

| Metric | Type | Labels |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `libp2p_module_protocol_stream_queue_depth` | gauge | `proto` |
| `libp2p_module_protocol_stream_dropped_total` | counter | `proto` |

`pingPeer` dials `/ipfs/ping/1.0.0` on a peer this node is already connected to.
Use it for a health check; it opens no connection of its own. `rttMs` is
measured around the write and the read, so it carries the two FFI hops on top of
the wire time. Compare it against itself over time, not against `ping(8)`.

# Building
Currently the recommended and supported building way is using Nix

## Build everything (default)
```bash
nix build
```
Or explicitly
```bash
nix build '.#default'
```

The result will include:

- `/lib/libp2p_module_plugin.so` (or `.dylib` on macOS) — The Logos libp2p module plugin
- `/include/libp2p_module_api.h` — Generated module API header
- `/include/libp2p_module_api.cpp` — Generated module API implementation

## Build Individual Components

Build only the library (plugin)
```bash
nix build '.#lib'
```

Build only the generated headers
```bash
nix build '.#include'
```

# Development Shell

Enter development environment
```bash
nix develop
```

This provides:
- CMake
- Ninja
- Qt6
- Logos SDK dependencies
- Proper environment variables

If flakes are not enabled globally:

```bash
nix build --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes'
```

To enable globally, add flake as a `experimental-feature` to `~/.config/nix/nix.conf`:
```bash
echo 'experimental-features = nix-command flakes' >> ~/.config/nix/nix.conf
```
